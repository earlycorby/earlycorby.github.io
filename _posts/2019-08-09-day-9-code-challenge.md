Now that we have the maximum temperature for the next 24 hours we can use that to determine what clothes the child should wear.
If the max is less than 20 degrees celcius he will wear long pants and top. If it is between 20 and 25, he will wear a short item
and a long item. If the temperature is above 25 degrees he will wear shorts and a t-shirt.
