Still working on the styling of the weather, What Shall I Wear, page. I want to change the background color according to the forecast temp.
I also want to put some pictures in.

Started working on random name generator. Specifications: names randomised but more popular names are more likely to be chosen. Names from more than one country. 
Just need first name to start with. 

Start with the City of New York json file and South Australian most popular names from 1944 to 2018, csv files.

To process the data I think I will need to use Java. Once I have the data in a format that I like then I need to write the front end, so the 
client can find randomly generated names.
