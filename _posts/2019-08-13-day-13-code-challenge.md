Found data that I can use to get names. I have a JSON file from the state of New York and a directory with CSV files covering 70 years from
South Australia. I need to open and process the two data types, get the data that I need and then create a new JSON file with just the data
that I want. Then I can put the JSON file on the server. In the user interface I need to create an array with the data from the JSON file and 
use a random number generator to select a name from the array.
